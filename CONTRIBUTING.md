# Contributing to Light Deemer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Light Deemer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/bhavy67/light-deemer/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/bhavy67/light-deemer/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Load the extension in Chrome for testing
5. Make your changes
6. Test thoroughly
7. Submit a pull request

## Code Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style (we use Prettier for formatting)
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Add tests for new functionality

## License
