## Introduction
Light Deemer is a Chrome extension designed to reduce eye strain by intelligently dimming bright areas on web pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how our extension works.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect
- **Settings Data**: Your extension preferences (dimming intensity, color, video exclusion settings) are stored locally on your device

- **No External Servers**: No data is sent to external servers or third parties
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics or tracking services

### Data Storage
- Settings are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage.sync API
