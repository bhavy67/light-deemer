# Icon placeholders

The following icon files need to be created:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be PNG files with the Light Deemer logo or a simple icon representing the extension's functionality (e.g., an eye with a dimming overlay or a sun with reduced brightness).

For development/testing, you can create simple colored squares or use any PNG files temporarily.

The icons should follow these guidelines:
- Clean, simple design that works at small sizes
- Consistent color scheme matching the extension's branding
- Clear representation of the extension's eye strain reduction purpose
- Meet Chrome Web Store icon requirements
